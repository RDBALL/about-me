### About Me

The goal of this project is to have a site that will serve as a brief overview of who I am. In addition, there will be JS prompts and functions utilized to find out who is visiting the page and then quiz that individual on 5 questions.

### Reflections and Comments

### Day 2

- What I should have done from the start is to get back to the basics and begin with a wireframe design.  At the moment there is not a lot of thought put into the overall design other than just meeting the requirements of the assignment.

### Day 3

- I still need to spend some more time and energy understanding for loops and the benifit of using arrays within the context of this assignment.

### Day 4

- The JavaScript solution to this guessing game is modeled after Adrians code during the paired programming assignment. https://github.com/AdrianButler
