    <p>Hi, thanks for taking the time to stop by!
    <br>
    <br>
    My name is Robert Ball and I am a software developer currently enrolled in Code Fellows coding bootcamp. I am also concurrently enrolled at the University of Arizona working on a post baccalaureate in cyber operations.</p>

    <p>My goal is to become a front end developer or work in cyber security forensics. Regardless, I see my future as being heavily involved in the tech and IT world.</p>

    <p>Before joining Code Fellows I was in the Army for 9 years. While in the Army I was able to travel around the world and had the opportunity to work with partner nation forces from many different nations.</p>

    <p>I'm originally from Montana and graduated from the University of Montana with a BA in History. </p>
