    My name is Robert Ball and I am a software developer currently enrolled in Code Fellows coding bootcamp. I am also concurrently enrolled at the University of Arizona working on a post baccalaureate in cyber operations.</p>

    <p>My goal is to become a front end developer or work in cyber security forensics. Regardless, I see my future as being heavily involved in the tech and IT world.</p>
